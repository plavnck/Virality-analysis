# Virality-analysis
Assessment of game virality based on the results of correlation and regression analysis

## Given data

Data is given as test_data.csv file. There you can see some statistics about game marketing results: date of users' registration, number of users that had registered because of marketing, number of organic registrations and gross revenue of those groups of users. There is a hypothesis that organic users are somehow correlated with users, registered because of marketing (because of word-of-mouth and etc.). 

## The task is

1. Calculate number of organic users that joined the game due to virality caused by marketing users
2. Calculate extra revenue due to virality
